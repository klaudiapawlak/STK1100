# STK1100 – Probability and Statistical Modelling

This repository contains coursework and mandatory assignments completed as part of the STK1100 course (Probability and Statistical Modelling) at the University of Oslo.

STK1100 course gives a basic introduction to probability and the use of probability models to describe random variables and stochastic processes. It also covers statistical inference — how to extract information from data.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Understand the concept of probability and master the basic rules of probability.
- Be familiar with random variables and be able to compute expectation, variance, covariance, and moment-generating functions.
- Know the most common univariate probability models (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Gamma) and have seen examples of bivariate models.
- Be able to perform computations with univariate and bivariate distributions and determine conditional distributions.
- Understand the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.
- Be able to use methods for estimation and construction of confidence intervals in simple scenarios.
- Be familiar with stochastic simulation and the concept of bootstrapping.

## 🔍 Assignment Highlights

- **Mandatory Assignment 1 of 2:** Calculating probabilities for people exiting an elevator, using conditional probability to find the chance someone forgot to feed a fish, and computing a fair yearly payment for a pension based on life expectancy data. The final task includes Python code to calculate and visualize the results using real mortality statistics.
- **Oblig 2:** Investigated confidence intervals using simulated sampling from normal distributions.
- **Oblig 3:** Demonstrated Central Limit Theorem using custom and built-in Python functions.
