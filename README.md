# STK1100 – Probability and Statistical Modelling

This repository contains coursework and mandatory assignments completed as part of the STK1100 course (Probability and Statistical Modelling) at the University of Oslo.

STK1100 course gives a basic introduction to probability and the use of probability models to describe random variables and stochastic processes. It also covers statistical inference — how to extract information from data.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Understand the concept of probability and master the basic rules of probability.
- Be familiar with random variables and be able to compute expectation, variance, covariance, and moment-generating functions.
- Know the most common univariate probability models (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Gamma) and have seen examples of bivariate models.
- Be able to perform computations with univariate and bivariate distributions and determine conditional distributions.
- Understand the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.
- Be able to use methods for estimation and construction of confidence intervals in simple scenarios.
- Be familiar with stochastic simulation and the concept of bootstrapping.

## 🔍 Assignment Highlights

- **Mandatory Assignment 1 of 2:** Calculating probabilities for people exiting an elevator, using conditional probability to find the chance someone forgot to feed a fish, and computing a fair yearly payment for a pension based on life expectancy data. The final task includes Python code to calculate and visualize the results using real mortality statistics.
- **Mandatory Assignment 2 of 2:** Working with the Pareto distribution to calculate cumulative distribution, median, expected value, and variance of income. The assignment also includes transforming variables, analyzing joint and marginal probability densities, checking for independence, and using Python to simulate and visualize probability distributions.
- **Final written exam:** Applying Bayes’ theorem to analyze medical test results, comparing diagnostic accuracy using sensitivity and specificity, and calculating conditional probabilities. The exam also involves analyzing joint and marginal probability densities, checking for independence, transforming variables using Jacobians, exploring log-normal and Pareto distributions, and using Python to estimate parameters, construct confidence intervals, and perform simulations.
