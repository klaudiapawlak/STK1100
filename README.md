# STK1100 – Probability and Statistical Modelling

This repository contains coursework and mandatory assignments completed as part of the STK1100 course (Probability and Statistical Modelling) at the University of Oslo.

STK1100 course gives a basic introduction to probability and the use of probability models to describe random variables and stochastic processes. It also covers statistical inference — how to extract information from data.

## 🎯 Course Objectives
- Understand the concept of probability and master the basic rules of probability.
- Be familiar with random variables and be able to compute expectation, variance, covariance, and moment-generating functions.
- Know the most common univariate probability models (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, Gamma) and have seen examples of bivariate models.
- Be able to perform computations with univariate and bivariate distributions and determine conditional distributions.
- Understand the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.
- Be able to use methods for estimation and construction of confidence intervals in simple scenarios.
- Be familiar with stochastic simulation and the concept of bootstrapping.

## 🔍 Assignment Highlights

- **Oblig 1:** Simulated dice rolls to explore the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and empirical distributions.
- **Oblig 2:** Investigated confidence intervals using simulated sampling from normal distributions.
- **Oblig 3:** Demonstrated Central Limit Theorem using custom and built-in Python functions.
